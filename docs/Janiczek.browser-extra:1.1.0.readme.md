# Additional Browser-related Functions

This package contains convenience functions for working with various Browser-related types, beyond that
which `elm-lang/browser` provides.

You may want to import this into the `Browser` namespace:

```elm
import Browser.Extra as Browser
```

Feedback and contributions are very welcome.
