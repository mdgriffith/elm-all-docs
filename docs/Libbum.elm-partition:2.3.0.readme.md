The partition problem is a mathematically [NP-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness) task which splits a set of numbers into two subsets, where the sum of these subsets is equal.

This library implements a number of different methods to obtain the subsets&mdash;some optimal and some fast.

## Roadmap

- [x] Brute force method
- [ ] pseudo-polynomial
- [x] greedy
- [x] largest differencing
- [ ] anytime
