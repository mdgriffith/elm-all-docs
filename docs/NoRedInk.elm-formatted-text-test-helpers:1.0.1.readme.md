# Test helpers for FormattedText

These are test helpers for this [library](https://github.com/NoRedInk/elm-formatted-text-19)

Provides some `Fuzzer`s for generating arbitrary formatted text to use in tests,
as well as a custom equality check that makes correct semantic comparisons instead of
relying on Elm's structural equality.
