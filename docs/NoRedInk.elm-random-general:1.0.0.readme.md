# Random.General

A library that provides convenient functions (generators) for creating random values.

The API is practically identical to elm's core `Random` library, but allows usage of different random number generators (RNGs) as a base.
This means that you can experiment with different RNGs and chose the one most appropriate for your application.

## Usage

For a full usage example, have a look at the implementation of [`Random.Pcg.Extended`](https://github.com/Zinggi/elm-random-pcg-extended/).
