# DEPRECATED

[jsonstore.io](https://github.com/bluzi/jsonstore) has officially shutdown in 2020. Therefore this package has no use anymore. I suggest to use [IzumiSy/elm-firestore](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/IzumiSy/elm-firestore/latest) instead, as it offers the same functionality.

# Elm-Jsonstore

This packages is for working with [jsonstore.io](https://github.com/bluzi/jsonstore).

Working with Jsonstore is a bit of a pain. There are a lot of undocumented edge cases
that can cost you a day or two to find. That's why i started this package to include both
the Json codecs as well as working Http functions.

* [miniBill/elm-codec](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/miniBill/elm-codec/latest/) also uses Json codecs to write encoder and decoder at the same time.
