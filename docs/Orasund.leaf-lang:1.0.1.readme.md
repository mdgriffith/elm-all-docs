# Leaf

Leaf is a multi paradigm scripting language for Elm. It is designed to be extendable to fit your needs.

Leaf is
* dynamically typed
* extendable (by normal Elm functions)
* based on Lua with a few features taken from Rust
* context sensitive (similar to Ports in Elm)
* small (50KB of pure Elm code)
