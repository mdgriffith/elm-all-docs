This package is inspired by [guid75/ziplist](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/guid75/ziplist/latest/) and Richard Feldman's conference [Making Impossible States Impossible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcgmSRJHu_8).

This package don't have automated tests. If ever some unexpected behaviour happens, please post an issue on gh or make a pull request that solves it. Also if you code some automated tests for the module I would love you <3 Thanks!

# ziplist

A ZipList is a list that has an element selected that can go through the whole list and act on it.

It is very useful if you need non empty lists or if you want to make complex radio buttons.
