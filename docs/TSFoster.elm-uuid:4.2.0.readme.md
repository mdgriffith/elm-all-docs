# Elm UUID

A universally unique identifier, or [UUID], is a 128-bit number,
usually represented as 32 hexidecimal digits, in the format
`123e4567-e89b-42d3-a456-426655440000`. This package provides a UUID type, and
functions for reading, creating, randomly generating, inspecting and formatting
UUIDs.

There are several versions and variants of UUID. This package supports
the reading of all variant 1 UUIDs (versions 1-5, those outlined in [RFC
4122][rfc]), and the creation of versions 3, 4 and 5. This covers the vast
majority of UUIDs in use today.


## Examples

```elm
import UUID exposing (UUID)
import Random


Random.initialSeed 12345
    |> Random.step (Random.list 3 UUID.generator)
    |> Tuple.first
    |> List.map UUID.toString
--> [ "88c973e3-f83f-4360-a320-d8844c365130"
--> , "78bc3402-e662-4d59-bac5-914be6425299"
--> , "5b58931d-bb69-406d-81a9-7746c300838c"
--> ]


appID : UUID
appID = UUID.forName "myapplication.com" UUID.dnsNamespace

UUID.toString appID
--> "2ed74b2b-10eb-5b44-93be-69aa8952caac"
```

## Roadmap

* More tests:
  * test fromBytes explicitly
  * fewer/simpler doc tests?
  * test against set of known v3/v5 UUIDs
  * split into smaller files?


## Q&A

### Are the generated UUIDs random enough?

Short answer: for most cases where you want to quickly generate a UUID on the
client, probably.

`Random.Seed` has either 32 or 54 bits of randomness, depending on your system
Version 4 UUIDs should have 122 bits of randomness. You should consider [how
best to generate your Seed][elmrandom2]. Although the API is a little messier
than using `UUID.Generator`, it is recommended to try using `UUID.step`, so
`UUID`s can be generated using four independent seeds. One way of generating the
seeds would be to use [`Crypto.getRandomValues()`][getRandomValues] to create
four 32-bit integers, and passing them in as flags or via ports.

### Which version UUID am I using?

You can check what variant/version you are using by looking at one of the
UUIDs, which should be in the format `00000000-0000-A000-B000-000000000000`.
If the character at position `B` is `8`, `9`, `a` or `b`, you have a variant 1
UUID, and this package is for you! The character in position `A` is the version
number. (If it isn't `1`, `2`, `3`, `4` or `5`, then it isn't a UUID as defined
by the [RFC][rfc].)

### Which version UUID should I use?

Probably either version 4 or 5, depending on your use case. Version 4 UUIDs
are randomly generated, while version 5 UUIDs are created from a "name" and
a "namespace", such that the same "name" and "namespace" produces the same
UUID.

If you want to use the UUID as a key for a value that may change over
time, you may want to use [`generator`][generator] to create version 4 UUIDs.

If the UUID will refer to something that will not change over time, or will
need to be calculated in some other way from some input data, consider using
[`forName`][forName] and [`forBytes`][forBytes] to create version 5 UUIDs
(version 3 UUIDs are very similar, but version 5 is recommended unless required
for backwards-compatbility).

### I have a suggestion/I've found a bug

Please [open an issue on Github][new-issue] and I'll get back to you as soon as
I can.

### I need to create version 1/2 UUIDs

This can't *reaallly* be done in the browser (as far as I know), but feel free
to [open an issue on Github][new-issue] anyway.

### I need variant 0 UUIDs!

Really!? Umm, well I guess you'd better [open an issue on Github][new-issue].

### I need variant 1 UUIDs!

This might be better suited in a separate package, but why not [open an issue on
Github][new-issue]?
