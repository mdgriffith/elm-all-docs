Window toolkit providing resizeable, draggable UI containers
====================

API Documentation [latest release](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/ThinkAlexandria/window-manager/latest)

# Notes
This library is an extension for
[ThinkAlexandria/elm-drag-locations](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/ThinkAlexandria/elm-drag-locations/latest).
This library requires you to directly integrate `elm-drag-locations` with your
code to be functional.


## Example
Two independently draggable and resizable windows. Drag handle area for the
entire window is light purple, green rectangles are handles for resizing in one dimension,
and dark purple corner rectangles are handles for resizing in two dimensions.
