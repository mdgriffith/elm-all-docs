# GLSL Generator

Generate GLSL code from templates and snippets

The purpose of this package is to generate GLSL code and corresponding elm type annotations.  
In can help to break GLSL code into smaller pieces and allows reusing of common parts.

It could for instance be used by a game engine to generate multiple variations of similar shaders as part of a build process.

## Examples

A complete example can be found here: [Physical.elm](https://github.com/Zinggi/elm-glsl-generator/blob/master/examples/src/Physical.elm).
