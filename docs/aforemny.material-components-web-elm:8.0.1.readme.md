# Material Components for Elm

A [Material Design](https://material.io/design) framework.

This library is based on [Material Components for the
web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web) (MDC Web).

## Quick start

This package relies upon JavaScript and CSS that need to be included in your
project separately. As a result, this library will _not_ work with e.g. `elm
reactor`. Instead you will need to use either a HTML file or a bundler, such as
webpack.


### Using HTML

You should [compile your Elm program to
JavaScript](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm.html#elm-make) and include
it in a custom HTML document. From that HTML document, you have to include the
following assets to use this library.

Please make sure that the last two assets match this library's version (ie.
8.0.1) exactly.

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500|Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/material-components-web-elm@8.0.1/dist/material-components-web-elm.min.css">
<script src="https://unpkg.com/material-components-web-elm@8.0.1/dist/material-components-web-elm.min.js"></script>
```

Refer to the [simple counter
example](https://github.com/aforemny/material-components-web-elm/blob/master/examples/simple-counter)
for a minimal starting point, specifically to the files
[`src/Main.elm`](https://github.com/aforemny/material-components-web-elm/blob/master/examples/simple-counter/src/Main.elm)
and
[`page.html`](https://github.com/aforemny/material-components-web-elm/blob/master/examples/simple-counter/page.html).


### Using a bundler

Install the JavaScript and CSS assets via npm:

```sh
$ npm install --save material-components-web-elm@8.0.1
```

Then in your `index.js` add the following imports:

```js
require("material-components-web-elm/dist/material-components-web-elm.js");
require("material-components-web-elm/dist/material-components-web-elm.css");
```
