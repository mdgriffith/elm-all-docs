# HTML internal

Use [arowM/html-extra](https://github.com/arowM/html-extra).
This is not supposed to be used directly.

This library exposes same functions as [elm/html-extra](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-community/html-extra/latest/) but the `Attribute msg` this uses is imported from [arowM/html](https://github.com/arowM/html).
