# json-helpers
Elm helpers for Json encoding and decoding of sum types.

This module was mainly designed to be used in conjunction with Haskell's [`elm-bridge`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/elm-bridge) module, but could be helpful in its own right.

It includes several helpers that might come handy, especially when decoding sum types.
