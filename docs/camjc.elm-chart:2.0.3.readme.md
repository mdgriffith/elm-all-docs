# elm-chart

An SVG chart library.

So far this has a pie chart.

This is designed to be a simple consumable pie chart, as well as a simple example of an elm package.

I am interested in adding more chart types over time.

The interface is kept intentionally simple, and I would like to maintain this simplicity.
