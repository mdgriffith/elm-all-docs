# Aria attributes for elm-css

A very basic fork of [fapian/elm-html-aria](https://github.com/fapian/elm-html-aria), where the Html dependencies have been switched from the core `elm/html` to rtfeldman's [`elm-css`](https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-css/tree/16.0.2) version, which means that you can easily use these aria attributes in workflows where you are using elm-css.
