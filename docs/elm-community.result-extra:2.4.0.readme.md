# Convenience functions for working with Result

[![result-extra Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/elm-community/result-extra.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/elm-community/result-extra)


This package contains convenience functions for working with the `Result` type.

You may want to import this module directly into the `Result` namespace:

```elm
import Result.Extra as Result
```

Then you can use the included functions similarly to the `Result` module in
`elm/core`. E.g., `Result.singleton 5` or `Result.isOk someResultValue`.


Feedback and contributions are very welcome.
