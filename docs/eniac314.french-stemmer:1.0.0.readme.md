# Porter Stemmer written in Elm language

Copyright (c) 2020 Florian Gillard

This an implementation of the French Porter stemmer.

This and the accompanying French stop words list should be used with https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/rluiten/elm-text-search/ in order to index and search documents written in French.

It is supposed to be used  as a drop in for https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/rluiten/stemmer, 


Porter Stemmer web site http://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer/

For quick tests tests/StemmerTests.elm.

For tests derived from porters example vocabulary see tests/StemmerTestsFullPorter.elm.

The full porter tests consist of over 20,000 test cases so take a while to run.

The full porter tests in StemmerTestsFullPorter.elm are generated by running tests/buildStemmerFixtureElm2.js with nodejs.
This small script reads in voc.txt and output.txt in local folder and produces elm code.

The following files in the tests folder are duplicates from those on porter stemmer website.

* voc.txt
* output.txt
