# elm-csv-decode
Decode CSV just like you decode JSON.

## Motivation
Another package for decoding CSV into data structures of your own is [`ericgj/elm-csv-decode`][elm-decode]. I had a hard time using the package because I was expecting it to be similar to [`elm/json`][elm-json], and it is subtly different.

This package is an exploration into if we could create a CSV decoder that is aligns more with my intuition.
