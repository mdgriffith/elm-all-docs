# Elm Teaching Tools

Tools for using Elm in the classroom.


## Use

Use in your project by adding `friedbrice/elm-teaching-tools` to your dependencies

    elm install friedbrice/elm-teaching-tools


## Lib

The `Lib` module root contains several modules that wrap or extend built-in libraries purely for convenience. Take a look at the docs.


## Labs

The `Labs` module root contains several labs that can be completed in the classroom. The labs are meant to be self-contained, so that students may use tools such as [Ellie][ellie-app.com/].
