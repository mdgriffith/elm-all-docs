# OLD DESCRIPTION

## graphql-to-elm support package

This is a support package for the [graphql-to-elm](https://github.com/harmboschloo/graphql-to-elm) code generator.

**Do not install this package directly! It is bundled with the generator.**

`graphql-to-elm` validates graphql queries and converts them to elm code. For every GraqhQL query document `graphql-to-elm` will generate valid Elm _types_, _encoders_ and _decoders_ that you can use in your code. [Find out more](https://github.com/harmboschloo/graphql-to-elm).
