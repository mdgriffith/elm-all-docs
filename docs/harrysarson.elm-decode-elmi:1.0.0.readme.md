# Parse Elmi

A work in progress parser for the binary elmi files generated by the elm compiler.

## Elmi Files

This section will contain a description of the data stored within elmi files.
In short elmi files are like c header files but for elm and binary.

## Use case

I have written this package as I hope to write a alternative version of elm-test but would like to minimise the number of exec calls that need to be made.
Currently, the elm-test runner extracts information about the tests defined in test files using <https://www.npmjs.com/package/elmi-to-json> which is a haskell cli.


## Credit

The files in this package are largely ported from the elm compiler so full credit
must go to the author of the elm compiler, Evan Czaplick.
