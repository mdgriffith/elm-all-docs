# Tuple.Extra

This module contains a collection of Tuple helper functions that I've found
commonly useful in a handful of projects. Instead of constantly redefining them
each time, it makes sense to have a published module to use and share!

I've also included a convenient `Tuple a b` type alias. I've found this more
readable in certain situations.
