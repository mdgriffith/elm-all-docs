# elm-iso-10303

This package provides functionality for encoding and decoding data in
[ISO 10303-21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303-21) (STEP file) format.
It is likely only useful as a base for higher-level packages that support
particular STEP-based file formats such as [IFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Foundation_Classes)
and the various [STEP application protocols](https://www.steptools.com/stds/step/step_2.html).
