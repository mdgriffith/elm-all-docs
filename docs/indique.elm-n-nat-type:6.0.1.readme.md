Just ignore `Moved`, it's just a dummy module that must be published.

There also needs to be more text here.

I like text.

Text is useful.

```elm
dummyExample : Never
```

This example shown nothing.

Thanks for your interest.

```elm
iDontKnowHowMuchMore : ()
```

It seems like you now understand everything.
