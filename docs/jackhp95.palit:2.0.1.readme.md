## THIS PACKAGE IS IN ALPHA
## CHANGES WILL HAPPEN FREQUENTLY

### Why use Palit?
- What is the concrete problem you want to solve?
  > Currently, each method of creating a UI in elm have some flaws.
  
  - Elm-UI
   1) If you like writing CSS yourself, this library isn't for you.
   2) If you like writing HTML yourself, this library isn't for you.
   
  - Tachyons & Tailwinds
   1) Doesn't typecheck unless you're using a wrapper.
   2) Doesn't do dead code elimination.
   3) Can't customize within elm.
  
- What would it mean for your API to be a success?
  1) It's nice to use
  2) Easy to Customize
  3) Doesn't impede writing CSS or HTML
  4) Reduces bundle size
  
- What specific things are needed to solve that problem?
  > Still working on it. I do think this is a step in the right direction.

- Have other people worked on this problem? 
  >Yes! Many brilliant minds have! However, their goals are slightly different.
  - Language
  - CSS Preprocessing, CSS, Post-CSS, CSS-in-JS
  - Scales and Color Palletes

- What lessons can be learned from them? 
  EVERYTHING! This package exists because of the brilliance of:
  - Adam Morse
  - Evan Czaplicki
  - Matthew Griffith
  - Richard Feldman
  - Brent Jackson
  - Nicole Sullivan

- Are there specific weaknesses you want to avoid?
  > Where the package is right now and where I want it to be eventually, are two entirely different places. I don't want people to think this package is ready for primetime. IT'S NOT! There will be breaking changes! I'm trying to find something I like, once I think it's a good experience, I'll start sharing it on slack and writing proper documentation.
