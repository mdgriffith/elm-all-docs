# elm-html-test-runner

The goal of this package is to allow tests to be run in a webpage and rendered in HTML.

First use case is to display tests in Elm-reactor for a workshop, without needing the attendees to install any CLI tool nor using any command.

The main drawback is that your test dependencies should be normal dependencies.

See the [examples](./examples) folder for more information on how to use this package.
