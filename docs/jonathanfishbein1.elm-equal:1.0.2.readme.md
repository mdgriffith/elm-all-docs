A module to define a equal typeclass

The Eq typeclass provides an interface for testing for equality. Any type where it makes sense to test for equality between two values of that type should be a member of the Eq class. All standard Haskell types except for IO (the type for dealing with input and output) and functions are a part of the Eq typeclass.

Eq is used for types that support equality testing. The functions its members implement are == and /=. So if there's an Eq class constraint for a type variable in a function, it uses == or /= somewhere inside its definition. All the types we mentioned previously except for functions are part of Eq, so they can be tested for equality.

ghci> 5 == 5  
True  
ghci> 5 /= 5  
False  
ghci> 'a' == 'a'  
True  
ghci> "Ho Ho" == "Ho Ho"  
True  
ghci> 3.432 == 3.432  
True
