# Quantum Computing Simulation in Elm

## Summary

A module for simulating quantum computing in elm

Currently there is limited functionality.  Quantum states can be represented using the Ket type and measuring bases can be represented using the Bra type

There are named states defined including ket0, ket1, ketPlus, and ketMinus

There are two quantum operations defined, the Hadamard and the Not gates
