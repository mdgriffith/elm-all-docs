# Even Faster Linear Algebra for Elm

A library for fast vector and matrix math. See the full docs [here][docs].

[docs]: https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/justgook/alt-linear-algebra/latest/

This is alternative to original [linear-algebra][linear-algebra]
and can **NOT** be used directly with [WebGL][webgl] , but is useful for
anything where fast linear algebra is needed.
