![Build Status](https://github.com/kalutheo/elm-ui-explorer/workflows/Elm%20CI/badge.svg)

[UI Component Explorers](https://blog.hichroma.com/the-crucial-tool-for-modern-frontend-engineers-fb849b06187a) and [Style Guides](http://styleguides.io/) have been around for a while now.
We don't build pages anymore but components that are assembled together to build systems.

In the Elm world, components are just called views, and are defined as [pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function).
Elm UI Explorer takes advantage of the composability and the purity of Elm and offers a way to showcase
your views and their states in a single tool.
This project is inspired by [React Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and styled with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### How to use it ?


### Quick Start 

First install the cli.
```
npm install @kalutheo/uie
```

Then initialize your project.
```
uie init
```

To run your explorer:
```
npm run uie
```
Finally, you should be able to see your explorer by visiting `http://localhost:8000`




### Manual Setup

Here is a basic example of a button showcased in Elm UI Explorer:

Add this to your `Main.elm` file.

```elm
import Html
import Html.Attributes exposing (style)
import UIExplorer exposing (UIExplorerProgram, defaultConfig, explore, storiesOf)


button : String -> String -> Html.Html msg
button label bgColor =
    Html.button
        [ style "background-color" bgColor ]
        [ Html.text label ]


main : UIExplorerProgram {} () {}
main =
    explore
        defaultConfig
        [ storiesOf
            "Button"
            [ ( "SignIn", \_ -> button "Sign In" "pink", {} )
            , ( "SignOut", \_ -> button "Sign Out" "cyan", {} )
            , ( "Loading", \_ -> button "Loading please wait..." "white", {} )
            ]
        ]
```

Then in your Html add a link to the Elm UI Explorer stylesheet

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  type="text/css"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kalutheo/elm-ui-explorer@master/assets/styles.css"
/>
```

You can now run the `Main.elm` application with the tool of your choice.

### Main Features

- **Deep linking:** You can easily share UI Explorer states by copying and pasting the url ( ex: attach them to your JIRA tickets, Pull Request etc... )

- **Categories:** Your UI Explorer can be divided into categories. Convenient if you have many views and you want to group them by family.

* **Plugins:** Elm UI Explorer has a mechanism that let you extend the tool by creating your own plugins. By defaults the library comes with [built in plugins](https://github.com/kalutheo/elm-ui-explorer/tree/master/src/UIExplorer/Plugins).

- **Customization:** You can make the header match your brand identity by changing colors, title and icons.


- **Responsivness:** The explorer navigation is adapted for devices with small screens.

- **Dark mode:** For aesthetic purposes, Dark mode can be enabled with one click.

### Best Practices

- For hot reloading, it's recommended to use [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app). [Elm Live](https://github.com/wking-io/elm-live) is also a great alternative that provides live reloading.

- In order to avoid CSS conflicts with built in UI Explorer Styles, consider using [elm-css](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/rtfeldman/elm-css/latest/) or [elm-ui](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/elm-ui/latest/). Theses tools use technics that prevent styles collisions by scoping the css.

- Try to adopt [SDD (StoryBook Driven Development)](https://medium.com/nulogy/storybook-driven-development-a3c517276c07), creating UI this way can be very efficient.

- Use [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) paradigm. This will help you build a scalable Design System.

* All ids (Story names and categories) should be unique (ex: DropDown Menu, Loading, Loaded etc... )
