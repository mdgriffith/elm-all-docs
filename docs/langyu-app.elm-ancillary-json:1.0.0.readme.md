## Introduction

This package provides additional convenience functions for working with JSON not
available in [elm-community/json-extra](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-community/json-extra/latest/).
As with all, `elm-ancillary-*` packages, these began as functions we've found
useful for `langyu` but often include additional functions.

## Installation

```bash
elm install langyu-app/elm-ancillary-json
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, so long as it has the potential to be generally
useful and isn't found already in the base `elm/json` or `elm-community/json-extra`
packages.
