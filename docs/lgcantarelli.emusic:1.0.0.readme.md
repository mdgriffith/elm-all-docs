DSL to write music patterns that looks like those available at sequencers, drum machines and daws. Based on HMusic.

You can actually play the written musics on any browser using the Tone.js adapter available at lgcantarelli/emusic-tone-js.

More instructions will be added as soon as this project grows bigger.
