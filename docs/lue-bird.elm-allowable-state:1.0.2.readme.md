> allow/forbid a state at the type level

# [allowable state](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/lue-bird/elm-allowable-state/latest/)

There are many types that promise non-emptiness. One example: [MartinSStewart's `NonemptyString`](https://dark.elm.dmy.fr/packages/MartinSStewart/elm-nonempty-string/latest/).

`fromInt`, `char`, ... promise to return a filled string at compile-time.

â†’ `head`, `tail`, ... are guaranteed to succeed.
No `Maybe`s have to be carried throughout your program. Cool.

How about operations that **work on non-empty and emptiable** strings, like
```elm
length : Text canBeNonEmptyOrEmptiable -> Int

toUpper :
    Text canBeNonEmptyOrEmptiable
    -> Text canBeNonEmptyOrEmptiable
...
```
or ones that can **pass** the **(im)possibility of a state** from one data structure to the other?
```elm
toChars :
    Text nonEmptyOrEmptiable
    -> Stack Char nonEmptyOrEmptiable
```

All this is very much possible ðŸ”¥

Let's experiment and see where we end up.

```elm
type TextThatCanBeEmpty unitOrNever
    = TextEmpty unitOrNever
    | TextFilled Char String

char : Char -> TextThatCanBeEmpty Never
char onlyChar =
    TextFilled onlyChar ""

top : TextThatCanBeEmpty Never -> Char
top =
    \text ->
        case text of
            TextFilled headChar _ ->
                headChar
            
            TextEmpty possiblyOrNever ->
                possiblyOrNever |> never --! neat

top (char 'E') -- 'E'
top (TextEmpty ()) -- error
```

â†’ The type `TextThatCanBeEmpty Never` limits arguments to just `TextFilled`.

Lets make the type `TextThatCanBeEmpty ()/Never` handier:

```elm
type TextEmpty possiblyOrNever

type alias Possibly =
    ()

empty : TextEmpty Possibly
top : TextEmpty Never -> Char
```

To avoid misuse like `empty : Text () Empty`,
we'll represent the `()` tag as a `type`:

```elm
type Possibly
    = Possible

top : Text Never Empty -> Char

empty : Text Possibly Empty
empty =
    TextEmpty Possible
```

ðŸ‘Œ. Now the fun part: Carrying emptiness-information over:

```elm
toChars :
    TextEmpty possiblyOrNever
    -> StackEmpty possiblyOrNever Char
toChars string =
    case string of
        TextEmpty possiblyOrNever ->
            StackEmpty possiblyOrNever

        TextFilled headChar tailString ->
            StackFilled headChar (tailString |> String.toList)
```
so
```elm
TextEmpty Never -> StackEmpty Never Char
TextEmpty Possibly -> StackEmpty Possibly Char
```

I hope you got the idea:
You can allow of forbid a variant by adding a type argument that is either `Never` or [`Possibly`](Possibly)

Take a look at [data structures that build on this idea](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/lue-bird/elm-emptiness-typed/latest/). They really make life easier.
