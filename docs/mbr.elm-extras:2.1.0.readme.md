# elm-extras

An experimental library. Do not use.

Collects various tidbits of elm code, reused across projects, that are either too small for their
own library or have not found a proper home yet.

## Example use

```elm
import Extras.Html exposing (nothing)

-- ...

view =
    nothing
```

## Word of warning

Expect changes and breakage frequently. Do not use this.
