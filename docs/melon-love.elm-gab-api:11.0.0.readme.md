[melon-love/elm-gab-api](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/melon-love/elm-gab-api/latest) is a pure Elm interface to the [Gab.com](https://gab.com/) application programming interface.

Gab uses a REST interface, documented at [developers.gab.com](https://developers.gab.com/). [Developer access](https://gab.com/settings/clients) is available only to Gab PRO members, but Andrew Torba [has offered](https://gab.ai/gab/posts/37368168) a trial of PRO to interested developers.

The [example](https://github.com/melon-love/elm-gab-api/tree/master/example) is a pretty good way to explore the API. It is live at [gabdecker.com/api](https://gabdecker.com/api).
