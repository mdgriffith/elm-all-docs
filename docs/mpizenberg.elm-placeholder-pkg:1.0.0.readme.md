# elm-placeholder-pkg

An empty placeholder package.
This package has as a sole purpose to exist in the package registry.
This can be useful for a number of reasons.

In order to be able to publish it,
the package contains an exposed module,
with an exposed constant, but this is not relevant.

In addition, it appears that this readme needs to contain more stuff.
I hope it will be useful to the people that will need it.
