# Additional Char-related Functions

![](https://travis-ci.org/Munksgaard/char-extra.svg?branch=master)

This module contains functionality to work with Chars beyond that which is in
[the Char library](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/Char).

There's not that much functionality yet, but pull requests are welcome. The goal
is to have it cover all of the additional functionality you might expect from
the regular Char module.
