# compgeo

An Elm library for computational geometry

I'm writing this library as a practical complement to my computational geometry algorithms lecture, so it should be finished by Jan 2020.

## Supported operations

### Fully implemented:
- convex hull

### Work in progress:
- line segment intersections
- triangulation

### Planned:
- kd-tree range search
- polygon-based geolocation
- Voronoi diagrams
- Delaunay triangulation
