# Time2.Zone

This is a fork of [justinmimbs/timezone-data](https://github.com/justinmimbs/timezone-data). We need this to return
[`Time2.Zone`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/pd9333/elm-time2/latest/Time2#Zone) instead of
[`Time.Zone`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/time/latest/Time#Zone).

Please refer to the original repository to see how the package works.
