# Elm Warrior

![Game in action](https://github.com/robinheghan/elm-warrior/blob/master/screen.png?raw=true)

This is a game where you hone your Elm skills by programming the AI of a brave warrior, named at, as it navigates mazes and battles dangerous opponents. 

You can find the documentation you need to implement your warrior here, but to get started quickly I recommend you clone [this repo](https://github.com/robinheghan/elm-warrior-starter). You can also try out this game directly in the browser using [ellie](https://ellie-app.com/989KZm4BrVMa1).

If you ever get stuck, you might want to take a look at this [walkthrough](https://juliu.is/elm-warrior-walkthrough/) written by Ju Liu.

If you complete all the builtin maps you can try to make some of your own, or you can challenge your friends in a warrior deathmatch by cloning [this repo](https://github.com/robinheghan/elm-warrior-multiplayer) and merging in your implementations.

Good luck, you'll need it!
