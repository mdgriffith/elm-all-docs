# sudo-rushil/elm-cards

A playing card library for writing games using standard card decks.

If you would like to use this package but some functionality is missing let me know [in GitHub issues!](https://github.com/sudo-rushil/elm-cards/issues).

```elm
import Cards

kingOfSpades = Cards.new "spades" 13
```
