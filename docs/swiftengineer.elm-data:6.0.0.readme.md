# Elm-Data

My goal for this project is to create something similar to `ember-data`, but redesigned for use in Elm applications.

Currently undergoing user testing at my company. If it is successful over the next week I will invest time in documenting it, otherwise this repo could potentially get tossed :(. Let's hope for the best!
