# Ui Base

This is a collection of convenience methods that I use across my projects, building on top of elm-ui.

It's probably of limited used to anyone else, unless you agree with my colour schemes!

The contents are:

## Colors

Role based colors. Use https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/phollyer/elm-ui-colors/latest/
for general named colors.

## Buttons

Consistent buttons of different sizes

## Alerts

One standard alert

## OnKey

Send messages when a key is pressed
