Accessible Modal component. WARNING -- experimental!

## About

This Modal component manages focus and adds dialog roles for you, following [these recommendations](https://bitsofco.de/accessible-modal-dialog/).

You'll need to label the first and last focusable element in your modal as such, in order to keep the focus trapped in the modal.
