# Decimal

Arbitrary-precision Decimal numbers for Elm.

This package is simply an Elm 0.19 friendly version of the original [elm-decimal](https://github.com/javcasas/elm-decimal) library. Prikhi updated the original for Elm 0.18 in the package [decimal](https://github.com/prikhi/decimal).

`unsafeFromString` was removed in this package from the original due to the remove of `Debug.crash` from Elm 0.19.
